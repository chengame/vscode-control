  - The extension queries the active editor for the symbol name and opens the corresponding location.
  - If multiple matches exist, a quick-pick list is shown to select the target.
- Example 2: Cross-editor cursor sync
  - User moves the cursor in VS Code.
  - Raycast prompts to mirror that cursor position in another editor.
  - The user confirms, and the other editor is updated accordingly.
- Example 3: Search and navigate
  - User searches for a file name from Raycast.
  - The extension shows a list of matching files across all connected editors.
  - The user selects a file, and the editor opens it at a designated start line.

Tips for power users

- Group related actions into workflows for common tasks
- Use the cursor sync feature when reviewing code across editors
- Keep your editors up to date to ensure compatibility with the extension

API reference

  - State changes propagate through a predictable event system

Error handling and troubleshooting
